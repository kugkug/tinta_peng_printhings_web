# Inventory Management Update - Products Module

## üéØ Feature Overview

The Products module now automatically manages inventory quantities when products are created, updated, or deleted. This ensures accurate inventory tracking and prevents overselling or creating products with insufficient materials.

## ‚ú® What's New

### 1. **Automatic Inventory Deduction**

When you create a product, the system automatically:

-   Checks if there's enough inventory for each item
-   Deducts the required quantities from inventory
-   Updates the inventory in real-time

### 2. **Inventory Validation**

Before saving a product, the system:

-   Validates that sufficient inventory is available
-   Shows detailed error messages if inventory is insufficient
-   Prevents product creation when items are out of stock

### 3. **Smart Inventory Adjustment on Updates**

When editing an existing product:

-   Restores the old item quantities back to inventory
-   Validates new quantities are available
-   Deducts the new quantities from inventory
-   Handles net changes efficiently

### 4. **Inventory Restoration on Delete**

When a product is deleted:

-   All item quantities are automatically restored to inventory
-   No manual adjustment needed

### 5. **Real-time Inventory Display**

The product form now shows:

-   Available inventory quantity for each selected item
-   Warning messages when requested quantity exceeds available stock
-   Visual indicators (red text) for insufficient inventory
-   Prevents form submission when inventory is insufficient

## üìã How It Works

### Creating a Product

**Before:**

```
User creates product ‚Üí Items saved ‚Üí Inventory unchanged
```

**Now:**

```
User creates product ‚Üí System checks inventory ‚Üí
If sufficient: Deducts from inventory ‚Üí Product saved ‚Üí Inventory updated
If insufficient: Shows error ‚Üí Product not saved ‚Üí Inventory unchanged
```

### Example:

```
Inventory:
- T-Shirt: 100 units
- Red Ink: 50 units

Create Product (Custom T-Shirt):
- T-Shirt: 1 unit
- Red Ink: 0.5 units

Result:
‚úÖ Product created
Inventory after:
- T-Shirt: 99 units
- Red Ink: 49.5 units
```

### Updating a Product

**Process:**

1. System retrieves old product items
2. Restores old quantities to inventory
3. Validates new quantities are available
4. Deducts new quantities from inventory
5. Updates product

**Example:**

```
Original Product:
- T-Shirt: 1 unit
- Red Ink: 0.5 units

Update to:
- T-Shirt: 2 units (increase by 1)
- Red Ink: 0.3 units (decrease by 0.2)

Process:
1. Restore: T-Shirt +1, Red Ink +0.5
2. Check: Need T-Shirt 2, Red Ink 0.3 (‚úì Available)
3. Deduct: T-Shirt -2, Red Ink -0.3
4. Net change: T-Shirt -1, Red Ink +0.2
```

### Deleting a Product

**Process:**

1. Retrieve product items
2. Restore all quantities to inventory
3. Delete product

**Example:**

```
Delete Product (Custom T-Shirt):
- T-Shirt: 1 unit
- Red Ink: 0.5 units

Result:
‚úÖ Product deleted
Inventory updated:
- T-Shirt: +1 unit
- Red Ink: +0.5 units
```

## üîç User Interface Changes

### Product Add/Edit Form

#### Item Selection

When you select an item, you'll now see:

```
Item: Plain T-Shirt (SKU: TS-001)
Quantity: [input field]
Available in inventory: 99
```

#### Insufficient Inventory Warning

If you enter a quantity higher than available:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient inventory! Available: 99, Requested: 150
```

-   Text turns red
-   Input field highlighted
-   Cannot submit form

#### Form Submission

Before submitting, the system checks:

-   ‚úÖ All items have sufficient inventory
-   ‚úÖ No invalid quantity entries
-   ‚ùå Blocks submission if any item is insufficient

### Success/Error Messages

**On Success:**

```
‚úÖ Product created successfully. Inventory deducted.
‚úÖ Product updated successfully. Inventory adjusted.
‚úÖ Product deleted successfully. Inventory restored.
```

**On Insufficient Inventory:**

```
‚ùå Insufficient inventory for the following items:
- Plain T-Shirt (TS-001): Available 99, Needed 150
- Red Ink (INK-002): Available 10, Needed 25
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity Features

### Transaction Safety

All inventory operations use database transactions:

-   If any step fails, all changes are rolled back
-   Prevents partial updates
-   Ensures data consistency

### Validation Layers

**1. Client-side Validation (JavaScript)**

-   Real-time availability checking
-   Visual warnings
-   Prevents form submission

**2. Server-side Validation (PHP)**

-   Double-checks inventory availability
-   Prevents concurrent access issues
-   Returns detailed error messages

### Edge Case Handling

**Scenario 1: Concurrent Product Creation**

-   Two users try to create products using the same item
-   System handles race conditions properly
-   One succeeds, one gets insufficient inventory error

**Scenario 2: Editing with Removed Items**

-   Product originally had 3 items
-   User removes 1 item, modifies others
-   System properly handles partial updates

**Scenario 3: Zero Inventory**

-   Item quantity reaches 0
-   System prevents creating new products with that item
-   Can still view/edit existing products (with proper validation)

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**ProductController.php:**

```php
// New: Inventory validation before saving
Check inventory availability
Calculate net changes for updates
Validate sufficient stock

// New: Inventory deduction
foreach items:
    $item->decrement('item_quantity', $quantity)

// New: Inventory restoration (on update)
foreach old_items:
    $item->increment('item_quantity', $old_quantity)

// New: Inventory restoration (on delete)
foreach product_items:
    $item->increment('item_quantity', $quantity)
```

**Key Methods Updated:**

-   `apiProductsSave()` - Added inventory management
-   `apiProductsDelete()` - Added inventory restoration

### Frontend Changes

**products/add.js:**

```javascript
// New: Display available inventory
When item selected:
    Show "Available in inventory: X"

// New: Real-time validation
When quantity changes:
    If quantity > available:
        Show warning (red text)
        Mark input as invalid
    Else:
        Show available (blue text)
        Remove invalid mark

// New: Pre-submission validation
Before form submit:
    Check for any invalid inputs
    Block submission if insufficient inventory
```

## üí° Usage Tips

### For Users

1. **Always Check Availability**

    - Look at the "Available in inventory" text
    - Plan product quantities accordingly

2. **Update Inventory First**

    - If you need more items, add them to inventory first
    - Then create your products

3. **Monitor Inventory Levels**
    - Check inventory regularly
    - Restock before creating multiple products

### For Administrators

1. **Set Up Alerts**

    - Monitor low inventory items
    - Plan restocking in advance

2. **Review Product History**

    - Track which products use the most inventory
    - Adjust inventory levels accordingly

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

If you have existing products created before this update:

**No action needed!**

-   Existing products are not affected
-   Inventory was not tracked before, so current levels are baseline
-   Future creates/updates/deletes will manage inventory normally

**Optional: Audit Existing Products**

1. Review all existing products
2. Calculate total inventory used
3. Adjust current inventory levels if needed
4. This ensures accurate tracking going forward
