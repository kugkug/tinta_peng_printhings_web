## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Reusable Product Codes

If you make the same product multiple times:

1. Use the same product code (e.g., `SHIRT-CUSTOM-RED`)
2. The system allows duplicate codes
3. Each instance is tracked separately
4. Great for recurring products!

### Tip 2: Check Before Creating

Before saving a new product:

1. Enter the product code
2. Click **"Check"** button
3. See if the code already exists
4. If it does, you can see what product uses it
5. Decide if you want to reuse the code or create a new one

### Tip 3: Use Meaningful Codes

Instead of auto-generated codes like `PROD-250127-A1B2`, use:

-   `SHIRT-RED-M` (Red shirt, medium size)
-   `WIDGET-V2` (Widget version 2)
-   `CUSTOM-001` (Custom order 001)

This makes products easier to find and manage!
